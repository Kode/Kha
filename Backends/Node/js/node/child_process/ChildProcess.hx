        Sending a signal to a child process that has already exited is not an error

        a message on its channel.

        Please note that the `send` method on both the parent and child are synchronous - sending large chunks of data is
        not advised (pipes can be used instead, see `spawn`).

        There is a special case when sending a {cmd: 'NODE_foo'} `message`. All messages containing a `NODE_` prefix in
        its cmd property will not be emitted in the 'message' event, since they are internal messages used by node core.
        Messages containing the prefix are emitted in the 'internalMessage' event, you should by all means avoid using
        this feature, it is subject to change without notice.

        The `sendHandle` option is for sending a TCP server or socket object to another process.
        The child will receive the object as its second argument to the message event.

        Emits an 'error' event if the message cannot be sent, for example because the child process has already exited.

        and it is no longer possible to send messages.

        The 'disconnect' event will be emitted when there are no messages in the process of being received,
