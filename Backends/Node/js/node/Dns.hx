	This module contains functions that belong to two different categories:

	1) Functions that use the underlying operating system facilities to perform name resolution,
	and that do not necessarily do any network communication. This category contains only one function: `lookup`.
	Developers looking to perform name resolution in the same way that other applications on the same operating
	system behave should use `lookup`.

	2) Functions that connect to an actual DNS server to perform name resolution,
	and that always use the network to perform DNS queries. This category contains all functions in the dns module but `lookup`.
	These functions do not use the same set of configuration files than what `lookup` uses. For instance,
	they do not use the configuration from /etc/hosts. These functions should be used by developers who do not want
	to use the underlying operating system's facilities for name resolution, and instead want to always perform DNS queries.
